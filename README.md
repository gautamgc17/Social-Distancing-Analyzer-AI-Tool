# Social-Distancing-Analyzer-and-Mask-Detector-AI-Tool

#### PROJECT OUTLINE
To ensure social distancing protocol in public places and workplace, this project aims to develop a Social Distance Analyser AI Tool that can monitor if people are keeping a safe distance from each other by analyzing real time video streams from the camera.

It can potentially detect where each person is in real-time and return a bounding box that turns red if the distance between two people is dangerously close. Further, it is capable of detecting whether a person is wearing mask or not using a pre-trained CNN-based model.

This can be used by concerned authorities to analyse the movement of people and alert them if the situation turns serious.
